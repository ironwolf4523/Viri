# Viri Discord Bot!
I've made an Viri discord bot based on [Jakeneutron's](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jakeneutron) [Endcard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNzAbQKI5RwGvxtk3ZvkXHyT11o01yKol) series

It's took about 3 days of solid coding and is coded in Javascript so you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for it to work!
## Dependencies
You need to install the dependencies for the discord bot to connect to discord, respond to messgaes in chat and play music in voice channels!
```bash
npm install discord.js
npm install discord.js-commando
npm install dotenv
npm install ffmpeg
npm install opusscript
npm install node-opus
```
## The .env file
I've decided to include dotenv as a secure way to pass your bot token to the Application, if your filming or taking screenshots of the code you don't need to worry about your token getting out as dotenv keeps it in a seprate file; 

To use dotenv you need to open the .env file and add your bot token from the [Discord Developer Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) Page
```bash
Bot_Token=<Your Bot Token Goes Here>
```
## The Music 
As i don't have rights to the song, i don't want to include the songs due to the copyright risk!
That means your going to have to source the audio your self, the location of the audio is 
```bash
/your download folder/bots/Viri/audio/Song01.mp3
```
