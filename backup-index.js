require('dotenv').config()
const {Client, RichEmbed, Attachment } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client();
const PREFEX = 'Change Me! ';
client.on('ready', message => {
    console.log('Logged in to Your Server!')
    console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`)
    console.log('Thanks For using my Bot')
    console.log('//IronWolf\\')
    client.user.setActivity('Change Me!', { type: 'LISTENING'});

});
//The Code Below Is for The Bot To Watch Chat So it's Aware What Been Typed and Respond Acordingly!
client.on('message', message => {
        let args = message.content.substring(PREFEX.length).split(" ");
        switch (args[0]) {
        }

//This String Needs To Be at The End So it Gets Your Logon Token (Placed In the .ENV File After the 'Bot_Token=', You Can Get a Bot Token By Going to discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
